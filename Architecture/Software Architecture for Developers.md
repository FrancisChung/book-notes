# Book Notes: Software Architecture for Developers

## Book Information
- **Title:** Software Architecture for Developers
- **Author:** Simon Brown
- **Publisher:** Leanpub
- **Publication Year:** 2022
- **URL:** http://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers

## Summary
- **Main Purpose:**  The book is for developers who want to gain a deeper understanding of software architecture and those transitioning from a developer role to an architect role. The Author takes a hands-on approach to bridge the gap between the high-level, theoretical concepts of architecture and the real-world challenges faced by developers working with complex systems.

- **Key Takeaways:**  
- Architects must be able to balance technical and non-technical considerations, adapt to changing requirements, and communicate effectively with all stakeholders.
- Quality attributes such as scalability, performance, and maintainability must be considered early in the design process to build resilient and sustainable systems.

## Chapter Summaries

- **Key Concepts:**  
	- **What is Software Architecture?** Brown begins by defining software architecture as the structure of a software system, focusing on the high-level decisions that shape its behavior, scalability, performance, and maintainability. He emphasizes that software architecture is not just about design but also about decision-making and trade-offs.
    
	- **The Role of the Software Architect:** The author explores the various responsibilities of a software architect, including the ability to make informed technical decisions, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and understand business requirements. The book stresses that architects must balance technical knowledge with an understanding of the organizational and business context.
	    
	- **The Importance of Views and Viewpoints:** Brown introduces the concept of using multiple views (logical, physical, and development views) to model a software architecture. He emphasizes the need for different viewpoints to address various stakeholder concerns, such as performance, security, and maintainability. The book introduces **C4** (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) as a model to describe architecture in a structured, visual format.
    
	- **Designing for Change:** Flexibility and adaptability are crucial for modern software systems. Brown discusses how architects should design systems to handle change over time, ensuring the architecture is adaptable, extensible, and resilient to changes in requirements or technology.
	    
	- **Quality Attributes:** The book covers various quality attributes (also known as non-functional requirements) such as performance, scalability, security, and maintainability. It guides architects on how to assess trade-offs between different quality attributes and the implications of these decisions on the overall system.
	    
	- **Documentation:** Brown addresses the importance of documenting architecture decisions in a way that is useful to both the development team and other stakeholders. He discusses how architectural documentation should evolve throughout the software lifecycle and suggests various techniques for maintaining clarity and coherence in architecture diagrams.
    
	- **Architectural Styles and Patterns:** The book provides an overview of common architectural styles and patterns such as layered architecture, microservices, event-driven architecture, and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Brown helps readers understand how to apply these patterns in real-world systems and make informed decisions about which approach to use.
    
	- **Communication and Collaboration:** One of the most important themes of the book is communication. Brown emphasizes that software architecture is a collaborative discipline and that successful architects must be able to communicate architectural decisions and design rationale to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
	    
	- **The Evolution of Software Architecture:** Finally, Brown discusses how the field of software architecture is evolving, particularly with the rise of agile methodologies and DevOps practices. He emphasizes that modern software architecture is no longer just about the “big design upfront” but must also accommodate continuous delivery, iterative design, and rapid prototyping.
	
- **Notable Quotes/Excerpts:**  

	- "As a noun, design is the named (although sometimes unnameable) structure or
	behavior of a system whose presence resolves or contributes to the resolution of
	a force or forces on that system. A design thus represents one point in a potential
	decision space." - Grady Booch
	- "All architecture is design but not all design is architecture." - Grady Booch
	- "Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system,
	where significance is measured by cost of change." - Grady Booch
	- "Big design up front is dumb. Doing no design up front is even dumber.." - Dave Thomas
	- "A master mason, then, is a manipulator of stone, an artist in stone and a designer
	in stone." - Unknown

## Personal Reflections
- Software Architecture practices must value-add, otherwise you're wasting everyone;'s time
- Up front design is about stacking the odds in your favour. Do not skip or skimp
- Design is about creating a starting point and setting a direction for the team
- Architecture ==>  Architecture as a Noun + Architecture as a Verb ==> Structure + Vision
